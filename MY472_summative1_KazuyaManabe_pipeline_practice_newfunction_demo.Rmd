```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r nhtemp}
#For pipeline excersise, I will use the default dataset "nhtemp" in R.
#Note I have noticed the title in {} was AirPassangers (not nhtemp) at this point(because I have tried some other datasets. Let me fix now.)

#Simple transformation function "data" which calculates an average of dataset:
#Biologically, the temparature's impacts are sometimes quadratic. So let's calculate the mean of squared value of the same dataset too. 

data <- function(x, y) {
  values <- c(mean(x), mean (y^2))
  return(values)
}

#Apply the function to nhtemp
data(nhtemp,nhtemp)

#Additional demonstration
data(nhtemp[1:3],nhtemp[1:3])
data(nhtemp[1:10],nhtemp[1:10])

#Let's say output value seems to stable regardless of what range you cut.
```
